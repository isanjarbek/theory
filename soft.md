5. Depency inversion principle

CI/CD pipeline - is a sequence of tasks that takes time from the creation of our software to its installation on the client side.

CI (Continuous Integration) - as soon as the programmer commits the code, the project will build and automatically
run unit tests on the build.

CD (Continuous Delivery) - In addition to CI, UAT is deployed and in some cases Acceptance Tests

CD (Continuous Deployment) - There will be one addition to the CD, which will take a new version of
